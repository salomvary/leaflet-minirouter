# Leaflet MiniRouter

Minimalistic route editor for [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/). Heavily inspired by [Leaflet Routing Machine](https://github.com/perliedman/leaflet-routing-machine), this library only provides
visual route editor layer over the map. No itinerary, no geocoding.

If you need a full-fledged route planner user interface use Leaflet Routing Machine. This one is for minimalists.

## Usage

See [examples/index.js](examples/index.js).
